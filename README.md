The purpose of this project is to close the gap between CPU and GPU performance metrics. To do so,
we picked three common benchmarks - Monte Carlo, Gaussian Blur, and Radix Sort, to optimize for
the Haswell CPU architecture. Contained in this repository is the result of that effort.

See the READMEs in each benchmark's respective directory for execution instructions.
