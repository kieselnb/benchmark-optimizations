There are three implementations:
- baseline.c : with the baseline implementation of the algorithm.
- optimized.c : with the optimized implementation of the algorithm.
- parallel.c : with the parallel implementation of the algorithm.

To Compile:
make compile

To clean:
make cleanup

To run baseline.c and optimized.c and see single_core.csv
make run_single_core

To run parallel.c and see parallel_cores.csv 
make run_parallel
