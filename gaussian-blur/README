Gaussian Blur

Optimized for Intel Haswell
################################################################################

############
Requirements

ImageMagick
    The run-tests.sh scripts rely on 'convert' provided by ImageMagick


###########
Quick Start

Optimized benchmark:
    cd optimized
    make
    ./run-tests.sh

Naive benchmark:
    cd ../naive
    make
    ./run-tests.sh


########
Overview

The original naive implementation (modified to use the third-party image
loading libraries) is located in naive/blur.cpp. The most up-to-date optimized
implementation is located in optimized/. See the git history for how this
implementation evolved throughout the course of this project.


#########
Compiling

To compile each implementation, go into each directory and run 'make'


#######
Running

Prereqs: The test-sizes.txt file is needed to run the benchmarks. This file
         can be generated using the first part of the MATLAB script
         compute_flops.m. An example is included in the repository.

There is a script in each directory called 'run-tests.sh'. This script runs
the appropriate implementation with the test sized defined in test-sizes.txt.
The number of cycles is output into a cycles.txt file, which is then read
by the MATLAB script to produce a comparison plot.
